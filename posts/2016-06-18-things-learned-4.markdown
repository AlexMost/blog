[Laney Kuenzel & Lee Byron - GraphQL Future at react-europe 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViXL0YQnioU)

> Nice status update for GraphQL. It is a quite young concept but already has a big ecosystem around it. Still there are a lot of questions but we already can start using this technology. Also describes how observables can help us to build reactive real-time applications.

[Dan Abramov - The Redux Journey at react-europe 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvAXVMwHJXU)

> The author of Redux highlights the core concepts and future of this library. Redux is built on top of a really simple idea and pure Redux, in a nutshell, doesn't give you a lot of features. What it gives is the contract and constraints about how you application state is changed. It is a relatively young project but it has a rich ecosystem around it already.
