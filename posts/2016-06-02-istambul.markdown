Last weekend I had an opportunity to visit one of the most populous city in Turkey - Istambul.
It was my first time visiting Turkey at all. I was travelling in company of 6 friends and we had a great time there. 
First of all I can say that it is a perfect city to spend your weekend. So if you have some doubts about visiting
Istambul go ahead and don't hesitate) I had visited not a big amount of countries
but Turkey is really something different from what I have seen already. Can't describe in what way it was different
but I had a little cultural shock there (in a good sense).
 
Here is our awesome company though (Blue Mosque on a background):

We were leaving not far away from that place (a couple of stops by tram).

# Blue Mosque
Here is the Blue Mosque by itself (huge and breathtaking):

Inside the Blue Mosque:

People allowed to visit it only without shoes. Man must be in pants (not shorts) and women must cover their head with showl.
Don't worry if you haven't nor pants nor showl - you can take them near the entrance for free.

Also there is a big and soft carpet inside, so you can just sit on the floor:

It's really awesome and big:
