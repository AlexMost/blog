Last weekend I had an opportunity to visit one of the most populous city in Turkey - Istambul.
It was my first time visiting Turkey at all. I was travelling in company of 6 friends and we had a great time there. 
First of all I can say that it is a perfect city to spend your weekend. So if you have some doubts about visiting
Istambul go ahead and don't hesitate). 

We were there for 4 days. Visited a lot of places and walked a huge amount of kilometers. I will try to highlight
the most interesting places that I have seen there and suggest you to visit. 
 
Here is our awesome company though (Blue Mosque on a background):

We were leaving not far away from that place (a couple of stops by tram).

# Blue Mosque
Here is the Blue Mosque by itself (huge and breathtaking):

Inside the Blue Mosque:

People allowed to visit it only without shoes. Man must be in pants (not shorts) and women must cover their head with showl.
Don't worry if you haven't nor pants nor showl - you can take them near the entrance for free.

Also there is a big and soft carpet inside, so you can just sit on the floor:

It's really awesome and big:

Here is another one mosque just infront of the Blue Mosque

# Topkapı Palace
It's a large palace and it was the major residence for Ottoman sultans and their harem. 
This place will take you at least a half of the day to visit.

Palace entrance gate (only sultan was allowed to enter it):

Inside the sultan harem (if I got everything right this room was for sultan's mother):

# Ferry walk across the Bosphorus
Quite cheap but impressive ride on a ferry - just for 12 TL (nearly 4$):

# Istambul Saphire
The tallest building in Istambul and
it has awesome observatory on the last floor. You can have some coffee there and just
watch the sunset. We spent a couple of hours there (also quite cheap place to visit something near 15 TL - 5$).

We decided to wait there until sunset to have a look on a night Istambul and it was really worth an hour of waiting:

# Bazaar
I was really impressed by Istambul bazaar. Turkish people are real trade masters. 
They like to bargain and do it really well.
