This is the second post about interesting things that I found around the internet during the last week.
Mostly about the web development.
 
# Videos talks, tutorials
[The ServiceWorker: The network layer is yours to own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uQMl7mFB6g)

>Nice introductory video from google developers of how we can use service workers and for what. What is offline first and why do we need it. 
Suggest to watch if you are not familiar with the concept of the service worker, it takes only 14 minutes find out the basics.

[Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)

>Awesome overview of this new concept. Another one argument for me to use service workers. This concept changes a little bit your thinking about what mobile application is and how you can implement it.

# Blog posts, specs or articles
[Fetch and XHR limitations](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/05/24/fetch-and-xhr-limitations/)

>Brief overview of the fetch object. Key features of fetch are promise-based API, support for streaming and also about how it suits better with service workers. Also states that XHR will be some subset of fetch API in future.

[Applicative do notation in haskell](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/ApplicativeDo)

>Interesting proposal for do notation usage in Haskell.

[Responsive web design basics](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/)

>Good knowledge base for developing responsive mobile first designs from Google. 

[Creating a Mobile-First Responsive Web Design](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/responsivedesign/)

>Nice article about mobile first design implementation details with real demo cases and implementation details.

[CSS Font-Size: em vs. px vs. pt vs. percent](http://kyleschaeffer.com/development/css-font-size-em-vs-px-vs-pt-vs/)

>Quite an old article, but still is relevant for making a decision on usage em vs pt vs px vs % for the font size on the web pages. 

[async/await, promises, and observables](https://zeit.co/blog/async-and-await)

>Good post about tools for async programming, but still leaves more questions than gives answers.

[medium image progressive loading](https://jmperezperez.com/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder/)

>Nice way for uploading images that is used on medium.

[intrinsic placeholders for images](http://daverupert.com/2015/12/intrinsic-placeholders-with-picture/)

>Another one good technique that prevents redundant page reflows during image loads.
